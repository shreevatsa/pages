The problem is that the latter recommends:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For best results, clean should not alter its output further if it is run twice ("clean→clean" should be equivalent to "clean"), and multiple smudge commands should not alter clean's output ("smudge→smudge→clean" should be equivalent to "clean").
#+END_QUOTE

This means that "clean" needs to peek at stdin and leave files starting with "U2FsdGVkX1" alone (not further "enc" them).

Similarly, "smudge" should only work on files starting with "U2FsdGVkX1" (other ones should be passed through).

Unfortunately, "clean" and "smudge" take input from stdin.
